# üåê IP Grinde

Welcome to the IP Grinde project, a versatile utility for cataloging and managing IP addresses (IPv4). IP Grinde allows you to store, filter, display, and validate IP addresses efficiently and user-friendly. You can also add additional features to enhance the utility of this tool.

## Key Features

IP Grinde offers the following features:

### 1) Persistence
Cataloged IP addresses are stored persistently by the program. This means your data remains saved between program executions.

### 2) MAC Address Filtering
You can search for IP addresses based on a user-provided address and mask. IP Grinde will return stored addresses that belong to the same subnet as the one provided.

### 3) Binary/Hexadecimal/Decimal Conversion
IP addresses can be displayed in various formats: binary, hexadecimal, and decimal. You can choose the representation that suits you best.

### 4) Validation
IP Grinde performs strict validation to ensure that only valid IP addresses are accepted. This prevents you from entering anything other than valid IP addresses.

## Main Loop
IP Grinde operates as an interactive menu with the user and only closes when the user desires. You can perform actions such as adding a new IP address, listing IP addresses, searching by mask, deleting an IP address, or exiting the program.
